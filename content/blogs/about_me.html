<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Hi, so as you know by now my name is <strong>Wybe</strong> (although on my passport my first name is actually Christiaan, but that is a story for another time). I was born in Prague and then lived in Barcelona, Paris and Amsterdam with my family. After graduating from the international school of Amsterdam I moved <em>back</em> to Barcelona to study at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESADE_Business_School">ESADE Business School</a>. In my fourth year I did my exchange in Austin, Texas at <a href="https://www.utexas.edu/">The University of Texas</a> which was a great experience! Now I am very excited to continue my academics at LBS doing analytics!</p>

The last couple of years I have not been too active as an artist, although I am planning to pick it up in the near future as my head is filling up with ideas for different paintings. Here are some pictures of paintings that I have made:</p>
