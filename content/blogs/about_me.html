<div id="introduction" class="section level1">
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Hi, so as you know by now my name is <strong>Wybe</strong> (although on my passport my first name is actually Christiaan, but that is a story for another time). I was born in Prague and then lived in Barcelona, Paris and Amsterdam with my family. After graduating from the international school of Amsterdam I moved <em>back</em> to Barcelona to study at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESADE_Business_School">ESADE Business School</a>. In my fourth year I did my exchange in Austin, Texas at <a href="https://www.utexas.edu/">The University of Texas</a> which was a great experience! Now I am very excited to continue my academics at LBS doing analytics!</p>

<h2>Hobbies</h2>
<p>Many people would not expect my passion for visual art and painting as a business student. However, since I was a kid I enjoy making art works. The last couple of years I have not been too active as an artist, although I am planning to pick it up in the near future as my head is filling up with ideas for different paintings. Here are some pictures of paintings that I have made:</p>

<p><img src="../../../../../../../../img/portrait.JPG" /><!-- --></p>
<pre class="r"><code>knitr::include_graphics(&quot;/img/tiger.JPG&quot;,error=FALSE)</code></pre>

<p>I have two younger brothers (2003 and 2008) that I get along very well with! My parents and youngest brother live in Amsterdam and so does my middle brother although he is studying at the university there. He, my middle brother, is called Beer and is actually the Dutch National Champion U20 for the 800m. This summer he actually went to Cali, Colombia for the U20 Track and Field World Championships. At 1 hour 51 min on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=399abdCsj4M&amp;t=6667s">this</a> YouTube link you can see his introduction and race!</p>
