## Feel free to explore some data analytics projects I have worked on during my Masters in Analytics:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/blogs/data_science_background.jpeg",error=FALSE)
```

### Easy

Simple data cleaning, t-test hypothesis to analyse differences in default rate between certain groups

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/blogs/bank_of_london.jpeg",error=FALSE)
```

### Medium 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/blogs/london_map.png",error=FALSE)
```

Using ggplot in R to visualize three trends in Stop and Search activity in London. Data downloaded from data.police.uk

### Hard

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/blogs/ml_picture.jpeg",error=FALSE)
```

Built multiple predictive models to predict the price of a given property. Compared linear regression, trees, kNN, GBD trees and stacking models

### Extra Hard

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/blogs/text_mining.png",error=FALSE)
```

Cleaning, inspecting and exploring a large data set (25 million rows) on movie ratings. Used a 2% of data to build and compare 3 collaborative filtering based recommendation models

Using the data from movie ratings, I performed text mining and PCA on the tags given for each rating

Next, I used the first 10 columns returned by the PCA calculated before to train and test an SVM model to classify ratings as being excellent or not

Lastly, the PCA data was used as an input to an Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
