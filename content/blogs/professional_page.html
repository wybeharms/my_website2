<p>The Masters in Analytics and Management combines detailed data analytics knowledge with business acumen. Below is a list of the relevant subjects covered:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Technical Subjects taught in <em>R</em>:</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Applied Statistics</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Covered the fundamentals of descriptive statistics such as probability distributions, variability, central limit theorem, data types and simple regressions.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Data Science</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Exposed to predictive analytics by reviewing parametric and non-parametric models such as linear and logistic regressions, lasso, KNN, and regression trees. Ultimately we combined all these models using ensemble methods and fine tuned the hyper parameters, did feature engineering and assessed the models.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<p><strong>Other activities at LBS include:</strong></p>
<p><em>London LAB</em> - a live 10-week business project</p>
<ul>
<li>OilX</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Investment Management Club</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Together with a Master in Finance Student we restructured the Student Investment Fund. This fund became rather idle during the pandemic with many old positions included that no one was covering. We set out to divide the fund according to a strategic asset allocation where 75% is invested in equities (MSCI by default, otherwise in stocks that were pitched to the committee and are covered by the respective analyst that pitched it) and 25% in fixed income (US Treasury). I pitched <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7032676604132655104/?actorCompanyId=68521920">BMW</a> (I’m not a car guy at all ;) which we added to the fund in April 2023!</li>

<h2>Zapp Quick Commerce (2021-2022)</h2>
<p><img src="../../../../../../../../img/blogs/zapp.png" /><!-- --></p>
<p>During my exchange in the US, I came across a new start-up called GoPuff which just raised many billions. Having interned at a Dutch online supermarket, I was intrigued by the concept of delivering groceries within minutes. I knew that usually new business concepts originate in the US and over time spread to Europe, but in this case, upon arrival in Amsterdam I was flabbergasted by the amount of ads for “20 min” grocery delivery services. There were four main players in Amsterdam in the summer of 2021: Gorillas, Getir, Flink and Zapp. All of these companies expanded to Amsterdam as the first city outside their respective home markets, hence the market was very competitive in Amsterdam. Having just graduated, I wanted to see the inside of these start ups, so I applied to the smallest, but fastest growing, of them all, London-based <a href="https://tryzapp.com/">Zapp</a>.</p>
<p>I joined in August 2021 in the Supply Chain Team as an Operations Analyst. The company was operating 3 dark stores in Amsterdam at the time with each store holding about 2000 SKU’s. The operations process of a dark store consisted of an order being placed, a picker grabing all the items, packing them into a paper bag, and then handing it over to the first available rider who would then bike to the address and deliver the order. In practice a lot would go wrong as the company expanded rapidly. It was my task to implement a clear and sustainable framework for data collection to improve the operations process.</p>
<p>As an operations analyst I was responsible for identifying the main in-store issues, measure them, create actionable insights, and give recommendations. This meant spending a significant amount of time in the stores hands-on to truly grasp the full process flow. There were many ad-hoc issues that made no day was like the other. The rapid growth of the company (Zapp expanded to 9 dark stores within a couple months) made tracking and reporting KPI’s especially difficult. Likewise, the many different data sources often caused confusion and created complex data sets. This required me to follow a structured methodology to obtain data from one source of truth. I did this by having clear communication with different departments such as HR, legal and the last-mile teams. This allowed me to work with people from many backgrounds and refine my interpersonal skills. Additionally, I was also responsible for converting all the major KPI’s into clear visualisations for senior management to understand in our weekly team meetings.</p>
<p>The small size of the company required me to take the lead in implementing the new processes and solutions that I proposed. One noticeable project was gathering all the hours worked by store staff and then building a model that would calculate the salary. This was complicated because the hourly wage was dependent on several factors and staff would not always accurately clock-in. I started using Excel sheets, but soon pivoted to writing Python code as this allowed direct input from the clocking system we used. It required a lot of collaboration with store staff to ensure that all the hours were correctly recorded for me to calculate salary payments. I stopped at Zapp in April 2022 to focus on studying for the GMAT and apply to masters degrees. To conclude, my exposure to a scaling business improved my interpersonal skills, analytical reasoning and ability to implement effective solutions.</p>

<h2>ABN Amro (2020)</h2>

<p>For my undergraduate internship, I interned at the third largest bank in The Netherlands, <a href="https://www.abnamro.com/en/home">ABN Amro</a> for a period of 4.5 months. The internship was in the Structured Finance division of the Corporate and Institutional Banking division. This division offers a range of financial services like cash management, capital structuring, equity capital solutions and structured finance. Most of the financing deals were syndicate deals (multiple banks coordinating to offer a loan), with ABN Amro at times being the lead arranger. I worked on several financing deals by performing company and macroeconomic analysis. An important priority of the bank was to incorporate sustainability targets in the financing deals, thus incentivising its clients to reach their sustainability goals by awarding them with lower interest rates. As an intern I had the chance to participate in multiple client meetings aimed at setting up these sustainability goals. My team also reviewed the legitimacy of the sustainability goals stated by clients by reaching out to experts in the field and analysing large amounts of information. Overall, the internship introduced me to a professional and corporate working environment, something I was still unfamiliar with at the time, while applying the knowledge learnt in finance subjects to real business cases.</p>

<h2>Crisp (2020)</h2>
<p><img src="../../../../../../../../img/blogs/crisp.jpeg" /><!-- --></p>
<p>My first internship was in the summer of 2020 at <a href="https://crisp.nl/">Crisp</a>, an online supermarket founded the year before. The pandemic restrictions contributed to the massive expansion of this young company, which focused on higher quality and locally sourced products. The main operations of the company were picking and packing all the orders and delivering them to the end customers.
My time at Crisp was primarily centred around bring the outbound logistics in-house. To do this I was tasked to develop a unit flow process to track the supermarket boxes in the warehouse as this would allow us to calculate the total lead time, and in turn decide at what time the delivery vans needed to arrive. Additionally, I leveraged historical data on sales, types of products and delivery locations to estimate how many vehicles we needed to add to the fleet. Ultimately, we introduced several new electric vans that had much more capacity, were standardized, and driven by drivers hired directly by Crisp. After conducting data analysis, we had to ensure that the warehouse operations aligned with the logistics in practice. My last task was to measure the impact of weather on traffic and in turn on delivery times.</p>
<p>To conclude, despite the internship being only two months, the great company culture and enthusiastic colleagues made me feel like being truly part of the Crisp team. The company went on to raise over 75 million from notable investors and continued its growth trend by capturing a solid market share in the Dutch online grocery market.</p>
