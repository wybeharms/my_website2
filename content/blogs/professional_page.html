<h2>London Business School (2022-2023)</h2>
<p><img src="../../../../../../../../img/blogs/LBS.png" /><!-- --></p>
<p>The Masters in Analytics and Management combines detailed data analytics knowledge with business acumen. Below is a list of the relevant subjects covered:</p>
<ul>
<li>Technical Subjects taught in <strong>R</strong>
<ul>
<li>Applied Statistics
<ul>
<li>Covered the fundamentals of descriptive statistics such as probability distributions, variability, central limit theorem, data types and simple regressions.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Data Science
<ul>
<li>Exposed to predictive analytics by reviewing parametric and non-parametric models such as linear and logistic regressions, lasso, KNN, and regression trees. Ultimately we combined all these models using ensemble methods and fine tuned the hyper parameters, did feature engineering and assessed the models.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Machine Learning
<ul>
<li>Evaluated supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms. Built memory-based and model-based recommendation systems, covered PCA and LDA, Support Vector Machines, and analyzed documents by means of text mining. Furthermore, we built a range of Neural Networks such as ANN, RNN, LSTM and CNN. On the main page you can have a look at a practical case I worked on where I combined many models to recommend movies to users and predict their ratings.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Technical Subjects taught in <strong>Python</strong>
<ul>
<li>Introduction to Python
<ul>
<li>Although “introduction” sounds basic, we quickly delved into web scraping, broadcasting and linear algebra. By studying the latter I learnt about Gaussian elimination, ranks, spaces and sub-spaces, inverse matrices, consistent matrices and eigenvalues.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Decision Analytics and Modeling
<ul>
<li>Having covered descriptive and predictive analytics, in this course we applied prescriptive analytics to provide useful insights. Using the Gurobi solver, we solved Linear Programming problems using both binary and integer variables.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Business Subjects
<ul>
<li>Operations Management
<ul>
<li>Applying numerical concepts like the Queuing model, capacity utilization and build-up diagrams on practical case studies.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Managerial Accounting
<ul>
<li>Reviewing fundamental financial and accounting methods and analyzing financial statements using CapitalIQ and FactSet.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Strategy Analytics
<ul>
<li>Using big data analysis and AI tools such as topic modeling and similarity analysis in strategic decision making.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Economics of the marketplace
<ul>
<li>Reviewed basic economics principles. Dove into markets with friction by looking at how network effects, pricing and WTA dynamics form platform mediated networks.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Other activities at LBS include:</p>
<ul>
<li>London LAB - a live 10-week business project
<ul>
<li>To be decided</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Investment Management Club
<ul>
<li>Together with a Master in Finance Student we restructured the Student Investment Fund. This fund became rather idle during the pandemic with many old positions included that no one was covering. We set out to divide the fund according to a strategic asset allocation where 75% is invested in equities (MSCI by default, otherwise in stocks that were pitched to the committee and are covered by the respective analyst that pitched it) and 25% in fixed income (US Treasury). I pitched <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7032676604132655104/?actorCompanyId=68521920">BMW</a> (I’m not a car guy at all ;) which we added to the fund in March 2023!</li>
</ul></li>

<h2>Zapp Quick Commerce (2021-2022)</h2>
<p>During my exchange in the US, I came across a new start-up called GoPuff which just raised many billions. Having worked at a Dutch online supermarket, I was intrigued by the concept of delivering groceries within minutes. I knew that usually new business concepts originate in the US and over time spread to Europe, but in this case, upon arrival in Amsterdam I was flabbergasted by the amount of ads for “20 min” grocery delivery services. There were four main players in Amsterdam in the summer of 2021: Gorillas, Getir, Flink and Zapp. All of these companies expanded to Amsterdam as the first city outside their respective home markets, hence the market was very competitive in Amsterdam. Having just graduated, it seemed interesting to see the inside of these start ups so I applied to the smallest, but fastest growing, of them all, <strong>Zapp</strong> and started working for them in the Supply Chain Team less than a week later.</p>
<p>When I joined Zapp in August 2021, the company was operating 4 dark stores (each dark store held about 2000 SKU’s and only used to do deliveries meaning that normal customers were not allowed to enter). The main roles in the store where the store leader, shift supervisors, pickers and all the riders. The operations process was rather simple: an order was placed, a picker grabbed all the items, pack them into a paper bag and hand it over to the first available rider who would bike to the address and deliver the order. Theoretically it doesn’t sound too complicated, but in practice a lot would go wrong. For example, the order flow and number of riders available rarely aligned, causing either riders to sit idle or a backlog of orders forming. There were also many issues regarding the replenishment and restocking of items with product locations moving around or general in bounding complications. These many ad-hoc issues made my job very interesting as no day was like the other. Interacting daily with store staff allowed me to tackle issues hands-on as opposed to making abstract calculations on an excel sheet. Regarding this point, the rapid growth of the company (Zapp expanded to 9 dark stores) made tracking and reporting KPI’s especially difficult. This was especially important to do because the head quarters of Zapp were based in London, meaning the upper management wanted transparent information. It was a fun task to gather and organize large amounts of data although also sometimes tiresome.</p>
<p>The rapid growth of the company soon hit a reality-check though as losses per-order mounted and the venture capital market started deteriorating. Furthermore, regulation for dark stores caught up in Amsterdam making the path to profitability ever-more challenging. Eventually I left the company in March 2022 to focus on studying for the GMAT and doing university applications. Being part of the boom, but also the bust, was a unique professional experience especially at such a young age. I learnt a lot about what to do, and what not to do, and still have close contact with former colleagues. I wish Zapp the best!</p>

<h2>ABN Amro (2020)</h2>
<p>For my mandatory internship I joined Holland’s third largest bank, <strong>ABN Amro</strong>, in the Corporate and Institutional Banking division. This division offers a range of financial services like cash management, capital structuring, equity capital solutions and, structured finance. I joined the latter for a period of 4.5 months. Most of the financing deals were syndicate deals (multiple banks coordinate to offer a loan), with ABN Amro at times being the lead arranger. An important priority of the bank was to incorporate sustainability targets in the financing deals, incentivising its clients to reach their sustainability goals by awarding them with lower interest rates. As an intern I had the chance to participate in multiple client meetings and see the project financing process first-hand. Additionally, the internship introduced me to a professional and corporate working environment, something I was still unfamiliar with at the time, while applying the knowledge learnt in finance subjects to real business cases.</p>

<div id="crisp-2020" class="section level2">
<h2>Crisp (2020)</h2>
<p>My first internship was in the summer of 2020 at <strong>Crisp</strong>, an online supermarket founded the year before. The pandemic restrictions contributed to the massive expansion of this young company, which focused on higher quality and locally sourced products. The logistics included inbound logistics, goods arriving at the warehouse which was often the responsibility of the suppliers, and outbound logistics, delivering the supermarket boxes to the end consumer. When I joined in June 2020, the latter was outsourced to delivery drivers who would arrive at the warehouse during the end of the day and then drive an assigned route to deliver all the packages. This was highly inefficient because drivers had different cars, weren’t trained, and generally had to drive long distances (for Dutch standards:). My time at Crisp was primarily centered around bringing the last-lime delivery in-house together with two colleagues. We introduced new electric vans that had much more capacity, were standardized and driven by drivers hired directly by Crisp. We had to align with the warehouse activities to ensure that boxes were packaged correctly and properly put in the vans. To conclude, despite the internship being only two months, the great company culture and enthusiastic colleagues made me feel like being truly part of the Crisp team. The company went on to raise over 75 million from impressive investors and continued its growth trend capturing a solid market share in the online grocery market.</p>
