title: Showcasing some of my Artworks
---



<p>Many people would not expect my passion for visual art and painting as a business student. However, since I was a kid I enjoy making art works. The last couple of years I have not been too active as an artist, although I am planning to pick it up in the near future as my head is filling up with ideas for different paintings. Have a look at some of my old works!</p>
