# Rents in San Francsisco 2000-2018

[Kate Pennington](https://www.katepennington.org/data) created a panel of historic Craigslist rents by scraping posts archived by the Wayback Machine. You can read more about her work here

[What impact does new housing have on rents, displacement, and gentrification in the surrounding neighborhood? Read our interview with economist Kate Pennington about her article, "Does Building New Housing Cause Displacement?:The Supply and Demand Effects of Construction in San Francisco."](https://matrix.berkeley.edu/research-article/kate-pennington-on-gentrification-and-displacement-in-san-francisco/)

In our case, we have a clean(ish) dataset with about 200K rows that correspond to Craigslist listings for renting properties in the greater SF area. The data dictionary is as follows

| variable    | class     | description           |
|-------------|-----------|-----------------------|
| post_id     | character | Unique ID             |
| date        | double    | date                  |
| year        | double    | year                  |
| nhood       | character | neighborhood          |
| city        | character | city                  |
| county      | character | county                |
| price       | double    | price in USD          |
| beds        | double    | n of beds             |
| baths       | double    | n of baths            |
| sqft        | double    | square feet of rental |
| room_in_apt | double    | room in apartment     |
| address     | character | address               |
| lat         | double    | latitude              |
| lon         | double    | longitude             |
| title       | character | title of listing      |
| descr       | character | description           |
| details     | character | additional details    |

The dataset was used in a recent [tidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) project.

```{r}
# download directly off tidytuesdaygithub repo

rent <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2022/2022-07-05/rent.csv')

```

What are the variable types? Do they all correspond to what they really are? Which variables have most missing values?

```{r skim_data}
skimr::skim(rent)

```

Make a plot that shows the top 20 cities in terms of % of classifieds between 2000-2018. You need to calculate the number of listings by city, and then convert that number to a %.

The final graph should look like this![](images/top_cities.png)

```{r top_cities}

top_20 <- rent%>%
  group_by(city)%>%
  summarize(num_listings = count(city))%>%
  slice_max(num_listings, n = 20)%>%
  mutate(percentage = num_listings/sum(num_listings))
top_20

#can also write!
top_20b <- rent%>%
  count(city, sort = TRUE)%>%
  slice_max(n, n=20)%>%
  mutate(percentage = n/sum(n))
top_20b



ggplot(top_20, aes(x = percentage, 
                   y = fct_reorder(city, percentage)))+
  geom_col()+ 
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format())+
  labs(
    title = "San Francisco accounts for more than a quarter of all rental classifieds",
    x = NULL,
    y = NULL)+
  theme_bw(base_size = 15)


```

Make a plot that shows the evolution of median prices in San Francisco for 0, 1, 2, and 3 bedrooms listings. The final graph should look like this

![](images/sf_rentals.png)

```{r sf_median_prices}

med_prices <- rent%>%
  filter(beds == 0:3, city == "san francisco")%>%
  group_by(beds, year)%>%
  summarize(median_price = median(price))

ggplot(med_prices, aes(x = year, y = median_price, color = factor(beds)))+ #factor changes categoricaldata (ex. 1 bed, 2 beds etc..) into numeric 
  geom_line()+
  facet_wrap(~beds, ncol=4)+ #ncol is used to display graphs in one line
  theme_bw(base_size = 15)
  
```

Finally, make a plot that shows median rental prices for the top 12 cities in the Bay area. Your final graph should look like this

![](images/one_bed_bay_area.png)

```{r spirit_plot}
#compute top 12 cities
top_12 <- rent%>%
  count(city, sort = TRUE)
top_12




```

What can you infer from these plots? Don't just explain what's in the graph, but speculate or tell a short story (1-2 paragraphs max).

# Challenge 1: Replicating a chart

The purpose of this exercise is to reproduce a plot using your `dplyr` and `ggplot2` skills. It builds on exercise 1, the San Francisco rentals data.

You have to create a graph that calculates the cumulative % change in median rental prices for 0-, 1-, and 2-bed flats between 2000 and 2018 for the top twelve cities in Bay Area, by number of ads that appeared in Craigslist. Your final graph should look like this


```{r}
library(scales)


#Get top 12 cities
top_12 <- rent%>%
  count(city, sort =TRUE)%>%
  slice_max(n, n=12)
top_12

top_12_all_data <- rent%>%
  filter(city %in% c(top_12$city)) #c(top_12$city) is a vector with all the 12 city names 
top_12_all_data
#now we have filtered the rent data set for just the top 12 cities

calc_median <- top_12_all_data%>%
  group_by(beds, city, year)%>%
  summarize(median_price = median(price))%>%
  filter(beds <= 2)%>%
  mutate(pct_change = (median_price-lag(median_price))/lag(median_price),
         pct_change = ifelse(is.na(pct_change), 0, pct_change),
         cum_pct_change = cumsum(pct_change)) #why does cumprod not work ???
calc_median

ggplot(calc_median, aes(x = year, y = cum_pct_change, color = city))+
  geom_line()+
  facet_grid(beds~city)+
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(scale = 100))+
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(2000, 2020, by = 5))+
  theme_bw(base_size = 15)+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))


```
