## The Early Years
I was born on the 17th of February 1997 in Vienna, under the name **Christoph Ewald Engelbert Plachutta**. My middle names are a tribute to each of my grandfathers, two names hardly found in this day and age, however with an "old-school-cool" aspect to them. Judging from my mother´s recollections, I was a rather large child with a seemingly endless appetite. While that appetite never ceased up to this day, I also developed an interest for sport and outdoor activities early. Going forward, I would spend most of my childhood outside with friends rather than in the kitchen with a fork and knife. My favourite sports from back then, which I practice to this day, include:

* Tennis
* Golf
* Skiing
* Motorsport

Given my [family´s business](https://www.plachutta.at/), I also had significant exposure to the gastronomy industry. I explicitly remember my enjoyment helping to open Coke bottles behind the bar when accompanying my mother during the summer months.

## Getting Smart
> *"We don´t need no education" - Pink Floyd*

Although it being a catchy song, *Another Brick in the Wall* did not turn out to be true for me: I did need some education. Given that I spent my entire childhood in Vienna, I cycled through quite a number of schools until my graduation (*4 in total*). This was not because I was struggling, I was actually always quite academically talented, but rather because each school provided a unique benefit. I transferred from my first middle school to an international school after barely half a year so as to **improve my English**. Once I reached high-school age, I transferred yet again, this time to a school focusing on the **hospitality and tourism sector**. There, I had a day every week dedicated to practical subjects focusing on cooking, restaurant service and beverages, next to my regular courses. While I learned a lot, it did mean that my high school education lasted an additional year and I spent my summers doing internships. I graduated in the summer of 2016 and was even selected to hold my classes graduation speech, which was well received by all the students and **most** of the faculty.

## SIR, YES, SIR
Graduating school did not mean relaxation. Just two weeks after receiving my diploma, I enrolled in the army, as is mandatory for any man in Austria. While I would rather have started my studies right away, my time serving was actually quite enjoyable. The first four weeks of bootcamp might have been strict and often tedious, but it was fun to go through it together with the rest of the squad. Afterwards, I was lucky enough to be selected to do the truck license, which is considered to be the most use one gets out of attending the military in Austria. Unfortunately, I managed to sprain my ankle just one day before the final exam and was therefore assigned to become an administrative assistant. My learning: **Do not jump the last step when leaving the barracks!** The position turned out to be rather dull and repetitive, but being close to the barrack´s command allowed me to negotiate shorter working days on Friday at least. 

## Allez á Lausanne
Disciplined and a military service medal richer, it was now time to head to my bachelor´s studies. I chose **École hôtelière de Lausanne** for my undergraduate education, in line with my background and education so far. While the name might suggest a heavy focus on the hotel industry, it was really a management/economics degree, with some classes including specifics on the hospitality industry. It was a truly an enjoyable time. The school was very international, which allowed me to establish a decent network and secure friendships with people around the globe. The faculty proved to be very knowledgeable and the classes engaging, especially as most assessments were project rather than test based. Life outside the classroom was centered around a plethora of student committees. They organised several events, most notably **fête universelle** (*a big event for students to present local traditions from their countries of origin in individual stalls*) and **fête finale** (*the graduation party for every intake, marked by a specific theme*). For the later, I even managed to land on the school´s official Instagram page, although rather incognito. Can you guess the theme?

```

I graduated in February 2020 after a total of 3 years. Instead of a thesis, the school asked students to complete a consulting report for external companies in groups of six. This proved to be a great transition into the working world, especially as I would eventully end up working in consulting.

## Road to LBS
I spent the last two and a half years either working or learning for the GMAT (*especially during the first lockdown*). In order, the companies I worked for are:

1. **Plachutta** - *helped my father adapt the business to the pandemic, ran operations for a while and established basic business intelligence practices*
2. **TX Group** - *a large private Swiss media group, where I interned in the internal consulting team*
3. **EY-Parthenon** - *worked as a full-time consultant in the Transaction Strategy & Execution Team*

For the later two, I lived in **Zurich** for a year and a half. As you might notice, I ventured quite far from the hospitality industry in which I started. The reason for this is twofold.

>**First**, I sought to develop myself by learning about other industries.
>
>**Second**, I developed a passion for more strategic work during my bachelor´s studies.

It was also during my work at TX Group that I decided to apply to LBS. I always wanted to do a master´s degree, however I was not 100% sure on the direction to go into. During my internship however, data played a big role in my work and was also a constant discussion topic in my team. Additionally, I spent a lot of time on websites like [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/), often reading about the amazing feats being done with data intelligence. So, I decided to apply to the MAM programme and was lucky enough to be admitted.

Now, here I am, just a few weeks away from the programme start. I am very excited about the year ahead, with all the people I will meet and things I will learn. While I cannot say what exactly LBS will have in store for me, one thing I know for sure: **LBS will play a key role in the Christoph Memoirs - Part 2.**
